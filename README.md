# Homework week 2 | Portfolio

This week I was tasked with creating a web application from scratch that will be my
portfolio page that I can add to as the course progresses. The portfolio will highlight 
my strongest work and give possible future employers an idea of my talents, skills and thought process.

## Some features of the web application:

* My name clearly displayed along with a head shot
* Links to sections of the web page (about me, work, contact & resume)
* Clickable images of my work (since I don't have any web apps yet, they are just placeholders)
* When the user resizes the page, the layout is responsive and adapts to the selected viewport
* I created links to all my contact information that opens in a new tab
