# Portfolio

This is my portfolio page. It highlights some of the best work I completed during my DU coding bootcamp I took in 2021.

## Some features of the web application:

* Clickable inks to sections of the web page (about me, work, contact & resume)
* The images of my work are clickable links that take you to the working app (FYI, the bottom 2 are placeholder, but will be updated soon)
* When the user resizes the page, the layout is responsive and adapts to the selected viewport
* The contact information at the bottome of the page are all clickable links
